## Introduction

In this session, we focus on **how Python stores and works with data**.\
Understanding data types and variables is essential because **all data analysis tasks depend on correctly handling data values**.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

-   Identify common Python data types
-   Assign values to variables
-   Perform basic operations on different data types

## Variables and Assignment in Python

### What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a name that refers to a value stored in memory.

```{python}
x = 10
y = 5
x + y
```

-   x is the variable name
-   = is the assignment operator
-   10 is the value stored in the variable

Variables allow us to store, reuse, and manipulate data. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful

### Rules for Naming Variables

-   Must start with a letter or underscore (\_)
-   Cannot start with a number
-   Cannot contain spaces
-   Should be descriptive and meaningful

**Valid variable names**

```{python}
age = 25
total_sales = 5000
```

**Invalid variable names**

```{python}
2age = 25      # starts with a number
total sales = 5000   # contains space
```

## Checking Data Types

Python automatically determines the type of data stored in a variable.

### Common data types:\*\*

-   **int** – whole numbers
-   **float** – decimal numbers
-   **str** – text
-   **bool** – True or False values
- **List (list)** – ordered, changeable

**1. Numeric data types**

```{python}
# - **Integer (int)** - Whole numbers (no decimals):
age = 25
participants = 120

# Check type
type(age)
```

**2. String assignment (text data)**

```{python}

course = "Statistics and Data Analysis"
message = "Welcome to Python!"

# Check Type
type(course)

```

**3. Boolean assignment (True / False)**

```{python}
is_registered = True
has_paid = False
passed_exam = True

# Check Type
type(is_registered)
```


## Numeric Data Types

Python supports several numeric types, but the most commonly used are integers and floats.

### Integers (int)

Integers are whole numbers without decimal points.

```{python}
a = 10
b = -3
```

Examples of integers:

-   Population counts
-   Number of observations
-   Age in completed years

### Floating-Point Numbers (float)

Floats are numbers with decimal points.

```{python}
height = 1.75
temperature = 36.6
```

Examples of floats:

-   Measurements
-   Averages
-   Percentages

## String Data Type (str)

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in:

- Single quotes ' '
- Double quotes " "
- Triple quotes ''' ''' or """ """ (multi-line strings)

**Key Points**

- Strings are immutable (cannot be changed)
- Supports indexing and slicing
- Used to store text

**Examples**

```{python}
name = "Python"
language = 'Programming'

print(name)
print(type(name))

```

## List Data Type (list)

A list is an ordered, mutable collection of items.

**Key Points**

- Defined using square brackets []
- Can store multiple data types
- Allows duplicate values
- Mutable (elements can be modified)

**Examples**

```{python}
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(numbers)
print(type(numbers))

mixed = [1, "Python", 3.5, True]
print(mixed)

```

**Modifying a List**

```{r}
numbers[1] = 25
print(numbers)

```
