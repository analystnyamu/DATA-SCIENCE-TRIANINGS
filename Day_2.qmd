## 1. Introduction

In this session, we focus on **how Python stores and works with data**.  
Understanding data types and variables is essential because **all data analysis tasks depend on correctly handling data values**.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

- Identify common Python data types
- Assign values to variables
- Perform basic operations on different data types

## 2. Variables and Assignment in Python

### 2.1 What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a name that refers to a value stored in memory.

```{python}
x = 10
y = 5
x + y
```

- x is the variable name
- = is the assignment operator
- 10 is the value stored in the variable

Variables allow us to store, reuse, and manipulate data. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful

### 2.2 Rules for Naming Variables

- Must start with a letter or underscore (_)
- Cannot start with a number
- Cannot contain spaces
- Should be descriptive and meaningful

**Valid variable names**

```{python}
age = 25
total_sales = 5000
```

**Invalid variable names**

```{python}
2age = 25      # starts with a number
total sales = 5000   # contains space
```



## 3. Checking Data Types

Python automatically determines the type of data stored in a variable.

### 3.1 Common data types:**

-   **int** – whole numbers
-   **float** – decimal numbers
-   **str** – text
-   **bool** – True or False values

```{python}
type(x)

```


## 3.2 Numeric Data Types

Python supports several numeric types, but the most commonly used are integers and floats.

### 3.2.1 Integers (int)

Integers are whole numbers without decimal points.

```{python}
a = 10
b = -3
```

**Examples of integers:**

- Population counts
- Number of observations
- Age in completed years

### 3.2.2 Floating-Point Numbers (float)

Floats are numbers with decimal points.

```{python}
height = 1.75
temperature = 36.6
```

**Examples of floats:**

- Measurements
- Averages
- Percentages

### 3.2.3 Checking Numeric Types

```{python}
type(a)
type(height)
```

## 4. Strings (str)

### 4.1 What is a String?

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.

```{r}
name = "Martin"
country = 'Kenya'
```

Strings can be enclosed in single or double quotation marks.
