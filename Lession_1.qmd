## 3. Python Features

### 3.1 Key Features of Python

-   **Simple and readable syntax**: Python code is easy to read and understand, making it ideal for beginners.
-   **Interpreted language**: Code is executed line by line, which helps with testing and debugging.
-   **Open-source and free**: Python can be freely downloaded and used without licensing restrictions.
-   **Cross-platform compatibility**: Python runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-   **Extensive standard library**: Python comes with many built-in modules for common tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.2 Python in Data Science

Python supports data science through a rich ecosystem of libraries, including:

-   **NumPy** – numerical and array-based computing
-   **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
-   **Matplotlib** – data visualization
-   **Seaborn** – statistical visualization
-   **SciPy** – scientific and statistical computing

These tools make Python one of the most popular languages in data analysis and research.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Python Ecosystem

### 4.1 Anaconda Distribution

**Anaconda** is a Python distribution specifically designed for data science and analytics.A complete package manager and environment manager for Python data science.

It includes:

-   Python interpreter
-   Popular data science libraries
-   Package management tools (`conda`)
-   Development environments such as Jupyter Notebook

**Advantages of Anaconda**

-   **Simplifies installation and setup**
-   **Pre-installed Libraries**: 250+ data science packages
-   **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, Linux
-   **Avoids dependency conflicts**: Isolate projects with different package versions. Dependency conflicts occur when different software packages require different versions of the same underlying library or package.

```{python}
# Package A requires NumPy version 1.20
# Package B requires NumPy version 1.24
# Both can't coexist in the same environment!

# This causes errors like:
# ImportError: incompatible library version
# AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'function'
```

-   **Ideal for beginners and academic use**
-   **Conda Package Manager**: Better than pip for scientific packages

## Conda vs PIP: Key Differences

| \# | Difference | Conda | PIP |
<<<<<<< HEAD
|---------------|---------------------------|----------------|---------------|
=======
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
>>>>>>> 8c55eebac763830d37d86e0793086be8c9f91061
| 1 | What it manages | Python packages, system libraries, and other languages | Python packages only |
| 2 | Compilation | Uses pre-compiled binaries (no compilation required) | May require compilation from source |
| 3 | Environment isolation | Built-in environment management with different Python versions | Requires `venv` or `virtualenv` |
| 4 | Dependency resolution | Resolves all dependencies together, reducing conflicts | Installs packages sequentially; conflicts may occur |
| 5 | Non-Python software | Can install R, C/C++ libraries, and compilers | Cannot install non-Python software |
| 6 | Package sources | Multiple channels (e.g., `defaults`, `conda-forge`) | Uses PyPI repository only |
| 7 | Use case focus | Data science and scientific computing | General Python development |

**Best Practice for Data Analysis:**

**Start with Conda for core data science stack**

```         
conda create --name analysis python=3.10 pandas numpy matplotlib
```

This command creates a new isolated Python environment using conda and installs specific packages into it.

**Use pip only for packages not in conda**

```         
conda activate analysis  # After creation, activate it:
pip install niche-package
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installing Anaconda for Python Data Analysis

### Step 1: Download the Installer

1.  Visit the official **Anaconda Downloads** page:

    👉 https://www.anaconda.com/download

2.  **Choose the correct installer**:

    -   Select the **latest Python 3.x** version
    -   Match your **operating system** (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
    -   Choose **64-bit** (recommended for modern systems)

3.  **Registration notice**:

    -   You may be prompted to register with an email address\
    -   This step is **optional** and can usually be skipped

4.  **Consider the installer size**:

    -   **Anaconda** (\~3 GB): Includes hundreds of pre-installed data science packages\
    -   **Miniconda** (\~400 MB): A lightweight alternative that installs only essential components
        -   Recommended if you prefer full control over installed packages

### Step 2: Run the Installer

1.  Locate the downloaded installer file.

2.  Double-click to launch it.

3.  Follow the on-screen instructions:

    -   Accept the license agreement
    -   Use default settings unless you have specific requirements
    -   For beginners, **do not change advanced options**

*The installation steps are similar across Windows, macOS, and Linux.*

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

**Launch a Terminal**

-   **Windows**:

    Open **Anaconda Prompt** from the Start Menu

-   **macOS / Linux**:

    Open the system **Terminal**

**Run the verification command**

``` bash
conda --version
```

### Step 4: Choose Your Interface (Next Steps)

After installing Anaconda, you can interact with it using **two main interfaces**, depending on your experience level and workflow preferences.

## 🖥️ Graphical User Interface (GUI)

You can launch **Anaconda Navigator** from:

-   **Start Menu** (Windows)
-   **Applications** folder (macOS)

**Why use the GUI?**

-   Ideal for **beginners**
-   No command-line knowledge required
-   Provides an intuitive **point-and-click** experience

**What you can manage with the GUI:**

-   Packages

-   Conda environments

-   Applications such as:

    -   **Jupyter Notebook**
    -   **JupyterLab**
    -   **Spyder**

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

You can work from the command line using:

-   **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows)
-   **Terminal** (macOS/Linux)

**Why use the CLI?**

-   More **powerful and flexible**
-   Faster for experienced users
-   Industry-standard approach

### Recommendation

-   Start with the **GUI** if you are new to Python
-   Gradually transition to the **CLI** for better control and efficiency

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2 Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an **interactive computing environment** that allows users to:

-   Write Python code in cells
-   Execute code and view results immediately
-   Combine code, text, equations, and visualizations
-   Document analysis step by step

Jupyter is widely used for:

-   Teaching and learning
-   Data exploration
-   Research documentation
-   Reproducible analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3 Python Libraries

A **library** is a collection of pre-written code that performs specific tasks.

Common libraries used in this course:

-   `math` – mathematical operations
-   `numpy` – numerical computing
-   `pandas` – working with tables and datasets
-   `matplotlib` – plotting and visualization

Libraries allow users to perform complex tasks with minimal code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Running Basic Python Commands

### 5.1 Starting Python

Python can be run in several ways:

-   Jupyter Notebook (recommended for this course)
-   Anaconda Prompt or Terminal
-   Python script files (`.py`)
-   Spyder

In this course, all demonstrations and exercises will be done using **Jupyter Notebook**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
